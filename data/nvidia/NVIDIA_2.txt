When asked about his work-life balance at a recent interview, the founder and CEO of $3 trillion Nvidia, Jensen Huang, said that he begins to work from the moment he wakes up and even when he is not working, he is thinking about work, seven days a week."I work from the moment I wake up to the moment when I go to bed, and I work seven days a week. When I’m not working, I’m thinking about working. And when I’m working, I’m working," the 61-year-old AI chipmaker boss told Stripe CEO Patrick Collison during a chat.few have the grindset required to even step in the ring with this man pic.twitter.com/jSaP4pf1e6Story continues below AdvertisementRemove Ad— bayes (@bayeslord) June 4, 2024He wakes up at 5 am, Huang said,  but prefers to read in bed till 6 am because he does not want to disturb his dogs. "I used to wake up at 5 (am), but these days, I wake up at 6 (am) because of my dogs... I don't mind waking anybody up, but I feel guilty when I wake the puppies up," he told Collison.Huang -- who is one of the longest-serving tech CEOs and the 14th richest person in the world with a net worth of $105.8 billion -- also said that some people think the "best jobs are the ones that bring you happiness all the time," but he doesn't agree with it.
