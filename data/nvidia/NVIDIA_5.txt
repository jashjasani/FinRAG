Tech giants Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Google-owner Alphabet are racing to build out their AI computing capabilities and dominate the emerging technology.The surge in shares pushed the stock to a record high, adding over $103 billion to Nvidia's market capitalization on Tuesday.Increasing the appeal for its highly valued stock among individual investors, Nvidia recently split its stock ten-for-one, effective June 7."A stock split can reduce the price per share, making it more affordable for individual investors to buy.
