Bill Gates, the author of several books, is now set to write his memoir which will focus on his early life and the start of Microsoft, the billionaire announced in a recent blog post. Titled Source Code, the new book will explore “the relationships, lessons, and experiences that laid the foundation for everything in my life that followed,” including building Microsoft into one of the world’s biggest tech giants and deciding to donate “virtually all” of his estimated $128 billion net worth through his philanthropic foundation."I’ve been in the public eye since my early twenties, but much of my life before then isn’t well known. Over the years, I’ve often been asked about my upbringing, my time at Harvard, and co-founding the company. Those questions made me realise that people might be interested in my journey and the factors that influenced it," Gates wrote.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThe book, which will be published in February, will also cover the tougher parts of the Microsoft co-founder's early life, "including feeling like a misfit as a kid, butting heads with my parents as a rebellious teen, grappling with the sudden loss of someone close to me, and nearly getting kicked out of college."Recollecting his formative years, Gates wrote that the book would also have the details about the challenges of dropping out of school to make a bet on an industry that didn’t really exist yet. "And I reflect on the luck I had to be born to a great family in a time of historic technological change and optimism, and to come of age just as the personal computer revolution was taking off," he said. "Source Code is my origin story, and I’m looking forward to sharing it."The billionaire has already written several books on business, technology, global health, and climate change.
